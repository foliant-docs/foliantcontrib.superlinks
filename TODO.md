- aglio first heading has anchor "top"
- confluence: not finished

known issues:
mdtopdf doesn't support russian characters in links
aglio headings with parenthesis won't work (because markdown links can't include parenthesis)
formatting in headings is likely to break anchors (todo?)
confluence: '' transforming to ’‘ sometimes(!)
