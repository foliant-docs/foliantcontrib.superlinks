- aglio first heading has anchor "top"
- confluence: not finished
* - links to global ids (customids, anchors)
* - confluence links to anchors
- write in readme about preprocessors order: includes should be placed BEFORE superlinks, customids — AFTER.
- write about param priority in readme?

known issues:
mdtopdf doesn't support russian characters in links
aglio headings with parenthesis won't work (because markdown links can't include parenthesis)
formatting in headings is likely to break anchors (todo?)
confluence: '' transforming to ’‘ sometimes(!)
